        <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <p>What inspired me to read more was the famous author Rohl Dahl, who not only made me ENJOY reading, but also ENCOURAGED me to. He's a very special author who has great writing skills which not only ENTERTAIN, but also TEACH the reader. For example if you were reading, The Twits, you would probably find a lot of NONSENSE WORDS in there, and other language features. You could learn from this book by looking at all the language features and studying this. I'm not saying you would have to, but its just a good thing to do.</p>
